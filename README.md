To deploy your Dockerized Python application using Kubernetes and Minikube, first ensure Minikube is installed and running. Clone your repository containing Dockerfile, deployment.yaml, and service.yaml files. Navigate to the repository directory and build the Docker image using `docker build -t my-python-app .`. Then, apply the Kubernetes deployment and service configurations using `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml` and `kubectl apply -f service.yaml`. Once deployed, obtain the Minikube IP using `minikube ip` and access your application in a web browser using the IP and specified NodePort. Ensure the application functions as expected. Update the repository's README.md with these deployment instructions.
